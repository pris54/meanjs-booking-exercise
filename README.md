# PRIS54.CO.UK - MEAN stack.

## A simple, one page website built using the MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.

This website works together with a headless Drupal implementation of a RESTful API. Angular provides the frontend and accesses the API. MongoDB works as a middle layer to store contact details.
