## Front End Skills Assessment

Estimated time: up to 2 hours (or whatever you feel necessary!)
The project should consist of two pages:

### Booking page

We would like you to create a simple page that allows a restaurant to capture details of reservations.
These details need to be held in some type of client-side persistent data store.
The details to be captured per-reservation should include fields such as:

   1. First Name
   2. Last Name
   3. Dining Date
   4. Number of Covers (How many people?)
   5. Phone Number
   6. Email

### Seating page

The restaurant concierge will look at the list of reservations that have been made, and will want to mark a reservation as seated when the guests arrive.

This page should retrieve the data that you captured in the Booking page, and should allow the concierge to mark a diner at one of two stages:

   1. Not arrived
   2. Seated

The work should be done using HTML and JavaScript, and the rest is up to you. Please use any frameworks and libraries you feel are most appropriate to show-off your skills.

This is primarily a JavaScript test, and overall we are going to be using this code to understand you coding style and approach. Feel free to make in-line comments to explain your code as necessary.

Added points for including any test or code coverage reports for the code you have written.

### Styling

We would like the UI to be simple and clean, this test is not about design or UX implementation, though we will be looking at mark-up and any styling you do provide.
